Linked list:
    Linked list is a linear data structure, in which elements are not stored in continuous memory locations
    each element in linked list is called node. a node  consists of data part and address which is pointed
    to another node

    Advantage over array:

    a) array is fixed memory size, there have chances to loss of memory if there have no enough element in the 
    array
    b) inserting an element to in between is little bit expensive

    Advantage:
    a) Dynamic size
    b) ease of insertion/deletion
